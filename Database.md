# Exercise 1: Starting a database project
---
### What sort of information will you need to get from the project stakeholders before you can begin modeling the database?

> The project stakeholders will need to decribe the different data they need to be able to log in the database for inventory, sales reports & schedule.

> e.g. Inventory: title, author, price, number of copies.
 

### How will you interact with your customers and project stakeholders during the database design process?

> During the database design process, the project stakeholders will have to be contacted frequenly by email and possibly in person or video chat, if there are any drastic design changes.


# Exercise 2: Gathering Requirements
---
> New inventory form: Paper form to collect information on the new titles that the store has received. One of the managers uses this form to update a spreadsheet that tracks store inventory.

> Inventory spreadsheet: A shared spreadsheet that lists all the inventory that the store owns.

> Customer receipt: An example of a sales receipt that customers receive.

> Monthly sales report: Each month, one of the managers manually produces a monthly sales report, which they provide to the store owners and management team.
